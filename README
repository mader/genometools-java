The GenomeTools genome analysis system (http://www.genometools.org) is a
collection of bioinformatics tools (in the realm of genome informatics).
This library makes some of the functionality of the GenomeTools available
to Java programs.

lib/                   JNA and JUnit libraries, needed for the unit tests

src/core/              Java source code for the ``core'' part
src/gtnative/          Java source code with native interface
src/extended/          Java source code for the ``extended'' part
src/ltr/               Java source code for the ``ltr'' part
test/                  JUnit unit tests and test data

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- a recent Java runtime(this code was tested using the Sun JRE 1.6).
- GenomeTools shared objects (e.g. libgenometools.{so,dylib} and
  libgtunstable.{so,dylib}) must be accessible to the dynamic loader.
  For example, this can be done using ``make install'' in the GenomeTools
  source directory to install it into a system-wide location or
  by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the location
  of these libraries.
- the Java Native Access (JNA, https://jna.dev.java.net) jarfile in the
  classpath (3.2.4 or later).
- the ``ant'' tool to compile the source

GENOMETOOLS BUILD OPTIONS
-------------------------
The Java bindings only act as a wrapper and call native code from the
GenomeTools libraries (see above).
To ensure compatibility, please make sure you are using the latest GenomeTools
version (1.3.5 or later). Also, one may also want to compile a thread-safe
version of GenomeTools (use the ``threads=yes'' make options).
To use the protein domain search functionality in the LTRdigestStream, the
GenomeTools libraries must also be built with the ``with-hmmer=yes'' make
option.

BUILDING THE JAVA BINDINGS
--------------------------
In the root directory of source tree, type

  ``ant build''        to compile the code
  ``ant test''         to run the unit tests
  ``ant jar''          to build a JAR-file containing the classfiles
  ``ant clean''        to remove all compiled binaries
