The GenomeTools genome analysis system (http://www.genometools.org) is a
collection of bioinformatics tools (in the realm of genome informatics).
This library makes some of the functionality of the GenomeTools available
to Java programs.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This code was tested using the Sun JRE, version 1.6.
For the Java bindings to work, one needs to have the GenomeTools shared objects
(e.g. libgenometools.{so,dylib} and libgtunstable.{so,dylib}) accessible to the
dynamic loader. For example, this can be done by using ``make install'' in the
GenomeTools package to a system-wide location or by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable.
Please make sure you are using the latest GenomeTools version (1.3.5 or later).
Also, make sure that you have compiled a thread-safe version of GenomeTools
(use the ``threads=yes'' make switch).
To compile the source code conveniently, use of the ``ant'' tool is advised (see
below).

BUILDING
--------
In the root directory, type

  ``ant build''        to compile the code
  ``ant test''         to run the unit tests
  ``ant jar''          to build a JAR-file containing the classfiles
  ``ant clean''        to remove all compiled binaries
